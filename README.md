## About this Project
This is only a small program that I wrote for fun :) You are welcome to try and play with it.  
The purpose of this program is to convert an image (only .jpeg tested) to a txt file which only contains several charactors.  
**Note**: For better visual effect, please use fixed-width font to view the file, such as monospace.  
**Note**: Now only an html will be generated after running the program, so that you can view it in any browser.  
## Requirement
  opencv > 2.0  
  cmake > 3.0  
  make
## How to use
Clone this project under any directories and run _make_.  
Usage:
```
./img2char <img file name> (optional)<width> (optional)<I>  
<width> : maximum characters per row in the output file.  
<I> : whether inverse the color.  
```
##Example
Following are two outputs from heart.jpg under test/ folder with width 20 and 50 respectively.  
**Note**: For better visual effect, try view test/heart-20.html using a browser.
